Story
You have just awoken in your research lab. For some reason you could barely remember anything from before you dozed off,but for some reason you feel you need to leave right now. Taking a walk out of your office, you discover that there is no one else in sight and the department that you work at seems to be abandoned. Looking in different offices you discover what is going on through looking at the research notes your colleagues have been making. From this it will guide the player along the level.

It has been apparent that a dangerous entity that the SCP foundation has been experimenting on has escaped its containment, causing the whole department to evacuate. The entity now roams in the upper floors.

To escape the facility in one piece, you would need to access the upper floor and get to the elevator that can lead to the surface. 

Playthrough
When the player spawns, they would need to find a way to get to the upper floor. Upon finding the door, there will be a turret that shoots any living thing in sight. The player will need to find a way to disable the turret. 

Once the turret has been disabled, a keycard is required to unlock the doors that lead to the upper level. 

Upon reaching the new floor, the player will encounter the monstrous entity that roams around. The player would need to sneak around to avoid the entity. At the same time, the player would also encounter a small robot that looks lost and scared. It would follow the player wherever they go from now on.

Once the player is able to sneak past the entity, they will encounter another turret. To disable it, the player must once again find a security that can deactivate the turret.

When the turret has deactivated, the player can finally enter the elevator by pressing the button. The player enters the lift and closes the door. As the elevator starts moving, the lights start flickering and banging can be heard. The light cuts out and a loud screech can be heard before the game ends ambiguously.
Win screen
When the player completes the game, they are brought to the win screen with text that congratulates them on winning and gives the option to replay the game or return to the main menu.
Lose screen
